# Bootstrap confidence intervals

The R scripts in this directory generate bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for the distribution function, based on the MLE (CI_bootstrap_Sen_Xu.R) and SMLE (CI_bootstrap_SMLE.R), repectively, using the data on the 88 travelers from Wuhan. The R script CI_bootstrap_density does the smae for the density. All confidence intervals are derived from the nonparametric MLE of the distribution function (the NPMLE).
