# Confidence intervals

The R script analysis_SR.R produces Figure 5 in single_double_int_censoring.pdf which gives confidence intervals and coverages of 1000 samples of size 1000 for the single interval censoring model If ne runs the script, one will see the numbers f the samples drawn and at the end tw picures, one of the confidence interval for the last sample drawn and one for the confidence intervals for the last sample at the points (number of days) 3 to 9.

All the confidece intervals of the paper were constructed by a version of the present supprt reduction algorithm.
